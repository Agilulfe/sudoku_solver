# Sudoku solver

This programs leverage constraint satisfaction algorithms to solve sudoku
puzzles. In order to run the program, run the following command: 

$ python3 driver.py <your_sudoku_puzzle_as_a_list_of_int_without_space>

Exemple:

python3 driver.py 000260701680070090190004500820100040004602900050003028009300074040050036703018000

The program will generate an output.txt file with the solution to this puzzle
as well as the algorithm used to solve it.
